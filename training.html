									<h1>My Training </h1>
									<p>In March of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic started, I capitalized on this opportunity to start my voyage in learning Python. 
										It was a rainy Saturday afternoon when I first discovered a YouTube channel called Programming with Mosh. I watched for 
										hours and was intrigued, having already been fluent in SQL and VBA for years I could immediately see 
										the use for learning these skills. Since starting this voyage, I have taken many data analysis/science courses.<br>

								<p><strong>Ask Better Questions - Build Better Relationships</strong><br>
									Relationships: we all want better professional and personal relationships. Improving your questioning skills is a powerful way to build 
									stronger, better relationships. That's why, according to Anthony Robbins, successful people ask better questions.<br>
									<br>
									Asking questions is a critical communication skill that most of us pay little attention to. It is the linchpin to building stronger 
									relationships, both professionally and personally. Learn to understand others before making, and acting on, inaccurate judgments that end 
									up making things worse rather than better.</p>
